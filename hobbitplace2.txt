Buckland! Located east of the Brandywine river, Buckland is home to some of the fiercest hobbits you'll ever meet. Due 
to, no doubt, the Fallohidish blood of Brandybucks, Bucklanders deal with adventures, thrilling experiences, hearty 
handshakes, and frequent jamborees. Make no mistake! Bucklanders may thrive on activity, but precaution is also their
middle name. Living next to the Old Forest, they are organised to deal with danger, and doors have to be locked every 
night. So if you're hardy, outdoorsy, and most importantly, lots of funsy- grab your stick, your backpack, and come on 
over to Buckland!
