A place where friendships sprout as readily as mushrooms beneath leafy green trees, the Shire is home to laughter, food,
and tales. From gardening, to farming, to writing, and to relaxing, a Hobbit will find there is never a short supply of
activity. For every Hobbit, whether they be a Took or a Sackville-Baggins, has a place here amid the rolling green hills
and kitchens smelling of fresh berries. Word of the Shire's hospitality has spread to every corner of Middle Earth, and
many visitors have found it to be their home away from home. So cast aside your shoes, pull out your oak pipe, and take 
a walk here at the Shire!
