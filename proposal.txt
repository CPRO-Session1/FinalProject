Final Project Proposal

My final project idea is for a program that Takes user input in the form of a name and then
checks that name against US census data from every decade of the 20th century to display a 
name's popularity during each decade. The program will display the data for each decade as 
well as other data such as whether the name is in an upward trend of popularity,
standard deviation, etc. THis will be done by importing a file with the name data, and then
checking the entered name against the names in the file and then reading the corresponding
popularity data. All the information for the stats for each name the user enters will be stored\
in a custom structure. I'm choosing this because it seems like an interesting task, and
something that could actually be useful when this program ends. If this is too basic, I could
possibly add a graphical component to it.
