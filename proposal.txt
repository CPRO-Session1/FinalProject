i-- Oscar So: Proposal --
I will be trying to create an unlimited calendar, where the user inputs which year and month, and the    n outputs the calendar for the chosen time period. If this fails, i will try to make a calendar for o    nly this year. i will use functions outside of main and call the functions throughout the project as     I think that calculating where the days are located (eg. monday, tuesday) for a given date will requi    re a lot more coding. I will also use arrays and loops to print out the calendar after scanning for t    he user input. i chose this project because I feel that this project is challenging because of the po    sitioning of the dates in the calendar given a random inputted month and year, eg aug 2158?.
