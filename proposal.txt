i-- Oscar So: Proposal --
I will be trying to create an unlimited calendar, where the user inputs which year and month, and the    n outputs the calendar for the chosen time period. If this fails, i will try to make a calendar for o    nly this year. i will use functions outside of main and call the functions throughout the project as     I think that calculating where the days are located (eg. monday, tuesday) for a given date will requi    re a lot more coding. I will also use arrays and loops to print out the calendar after scanning for t    he user input. i chose this project because I feel that this project is challenging because of the po    sitioning of the dates in the calendar given a random inputted month and year, eg aug 2158?.
SUN MON TUE WED THU FRI SAT
                        1
2   3   4   5   6   7   8
9   10  11  12  13  14  15
........... etc.

Change after comments:
Furthermore it will be an events calendar and I will use file input output to store the inputs of the user, where the event will be displayed on their selected date.

final Project:
Finished inital proposal, added more such as next and previous day and month.
tried to  do the second part with user input output, but only got to doing it within the running function. When it quits, nothing is saved and nothing is loaded. Will continue to write that another day.
took into account most invalid user inputs, but not all, for example, typing char for year month and day will result in infinite fail loop.
Also, the schedule will appear the same for every day, as I did not have time to add different files.
