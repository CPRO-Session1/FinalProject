	For my final project I would like to make a battleship game. The rules will be very similar to the classic board game except the user will be able to customize their level and how large/small they would like the board to be. The easier the level, the more ships will be placed on the board (for a higher probability of hitting the ships). Depending on how much time it takes to code the basic parts of the game, I may have the board write to an external file, but I most likely will just print the board and the computer's moves.
	This project will use a lot of arrays and conditional statements. The board will be a 2D array and the conditional statements will represent different scenarios, for example if the user hits a ship. It will also use functions so, instead of rewriting what happens when a ship is hit, I can just call a function to change the score/lives. The entire game will be in a loop while the user has ships left. 
	I would like to make this project because Battleship is a popular game and I think that it combines many of the topics we have covered. I have made many games in the past in Java but this would be my first of this type and in C. 
	I plan on using the standard input/output library as well as <assert.h> to check if certain conditions are met (like hitting a ship) and <time.h> to choose random spots to place the ship. These are the only ones I can think of now but I may have to add more as I go.
