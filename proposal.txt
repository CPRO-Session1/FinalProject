1. My program will simulate an app that acts as a directory to keep all the user's contacts in place. Unlike a regular contact book, this program would also be able to categorize contacts and add ratings.

Functions of the program:
- Store contacts
- Categorize contacts into groups such as family, food, clothes
- Create categories
- Add and edit details to each contact, which are name, telephone number, ratings(for businesses especially), category and address
- Display a list of all the contacts under a category
- Display chosen contact's details

What the program cannot do:
- Text and call

2. Detailed Examples of Concept Implementation
Input
- takes in contact details from user i.e. name, telephone number, rating, address, category
- takes in category name from user
- takes in commands from user such as to display a list of all contacts in a category, display the chosen contact's details, or edit contact details

Output
- displaying contact details
- displaying categories
- displaying contacts under a specific category

Conditional Statements
- Processes user commands to see what they would like to do, such as create a contact, edit contact details, create new category, etc.

Loops
- For loops to print out contents of a category

Functions
- Function to add contact details to a category
- Function to create new category
- Function to finish program
- Function to display category contents
- Function to display contact details

Arrays/strings
- Each category would be an array
- Each contact detail is a string

Advanced data types: structs
- Each contact would be a struct that would contain name, address, telephone number, rating and category

3. Reasons for picking this project
I chose to do this project because I wanted to create some kind of 'app' that someone could use on a phone. I also wanted to do something that could be quite useful, compared to games.
