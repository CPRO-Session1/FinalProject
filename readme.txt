CarrotCore Education Services 
by Rumeeet Goradia

The objective of this program was to mimic online gradebook programs used by teachers. The functions of CarrotCore are listed in the main menu, which holds 5 options. However, only 2 of these have been coded completely, the reason being I simply ran out of time. There are two causes for this:
	1. I tried experimenting with a GUI for the past few days. Eventually, it became too complicated to deal with; using the ncurses header file is not as simple as online tutorials make it appear, especially when you have menus within menus within menus So, I essentially wasted time trying to mak the GUI work, even though ultimately I decided not to use it.
	2. The first do-while statement is messed up, and I cannot figure out why. I asked Ms. Hsu too, and we reached a conclusion that I should hardcode the memory allocation for the username, but doing so still has not helped. Therefore, I have had to go off of base theory and have been unable to test my functions.
I will continue to update my program and try to fix the do-while statement, but until then, although the program compiles, it will not really. I went beyond my proposal and included file input, and i have included most if not all of the other element requirements. I apologize for the poor quality of the program, but I believe my code is thorough enough to be reviewed. As aforementioned, I will continue to update the program.
