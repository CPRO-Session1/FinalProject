Game Description:
This game is designed so that you are on the run from the police. It starts by giving a brief description and before every turn, the game displays the options that you can use. Randomly, a hiding spot will appear and you will have the option of hiding there. There is a chance that you will escape the police from that, but if you don't, the police will still keep moving. If you want to quit, press q and it will ask if you are sure that you want to quit. You can input your choice after it tells you all of the options. You can run it using the executable file that will be given to you.

To win the game:
There are a couple of ways to win the game. You can get 35 miles or farther from the police. Also, if you try to hide from the police, there is a chance that you will win. 

Changes:
I added the hiding places and took out the name. The name did not seem important and the idea of hiding places was much better. I also changed "running out of oil" to "fixing the engine" to make the game more realistic. I also added durability and car crashes. The car will be able to  survive one car crash, and if the person does not fix it and it crashes again, the user loses.

Compilation:
To compile, use "gcc project.c -o project"
