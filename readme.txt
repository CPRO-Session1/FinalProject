Readme


This project includes instuctions but to run it it must becompiled and then in terminal type ./final. Instructions for the Type adventure game are then given through the program. All the user has to do is enter their name and then follow the instructions of 1 or 2 and answering a riddle.


The only thing that doesnt follow the original plan is the array implimented to give the riddles. There is a loop that goes through an array of riddles. I added this so that it would include arrays and loops, but it really adds to the game and prevents it from being too short. 

Every thing leads you to the end. One answer says that you do not make it to class, but the rest are successful. 

Thanks for a great three weeks.

Best,
Emma
