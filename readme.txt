Final Project ReadMe document

The program file is titled NameAnalysis.c, and the executable file for it is NameAnalysisExecutable.
To run the program, simply type ./NameAnalysisExecutable. Once the program is running, it's very
simple to use: just type a name following the instructions on screen then hit enter. The program
is fairly self-explanatory, but just to reiterate it here: The program stores census data 
corresponding to first names from each decade in the 20th century to a structure array, and then
retrieves the data as well as calculates other meaningful statistics for the name the user requests,
or prints that the name was not found. 

What ended up being the code is what I layed out in the proposal, so no changes there.

	I'm not sure where exactly the Census Data is from, I got it from my computer science teacher
	back home. 
	I don't know if I have to credit Ms. Hsu or Lesley since you already know what you contributed,
	but you guys debugged part of my program and helped with the string tokenizer.
