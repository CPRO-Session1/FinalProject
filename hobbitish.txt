You, a Hobbit of the Shire, speak Hobbitish, a sub-dialect of Westron(the common tongue). Spoken in only rustic 
agricultural regions, Hobbitish contains many simplifications and archaisms. It contains no deferential pronoun, 
and Gondorians often comment that "Hobbit-speech sounds a little strange."
