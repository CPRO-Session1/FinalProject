For my final project, I want to implement a game of the card game, SET. I will make it a little simpler due to my limitations of graphic design, but it will still have the same concept as the game itself. The user will play against themselves in order to try and find as many sets possible in the cards that are dealt.  
I will use functions to determine whether a set that the user chooses is actually a set. I will use loops to implement those functions. I will use structures to create the cards, since they are made up of many different characteristics. I will also use UNICODE to display the cards. 
I picked this project, because when I was younger I used to play this game all the time and it has remained one of my favorites. Playing the game stimulates the brain and I think that writing the code that will implement this game will do the same.
