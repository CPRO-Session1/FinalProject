Ava's Quiz Game

This is a quiz show game programmed in C during Columbia HSP. My project takes questions from 'questions.txt' and answers from 'answer.txt' to these questions. There is a 'help' center, a 'quit' command, and a command to start the game. All instructions of how to play the game are inside of the game. This is a one player game.


In my proposal, I mentioned including a timer; however, I decided in the end not to add one. I also stated in my introduction that I would have different slots for different categories with different point systems. I later decided that I would not have different categories but a list of questions that players of  'Ava's Quiz Game' would need to answer. Although I did not have time to include graphics, I created a fun looking 'main menu'!

All of the answers to the questions, if you want to beat the game, are in answer.txt . 


I got my idea of how to set up Ava's Quiz Show here: http://www.codewithc.com/quiz-game-mini-project-in-c/ 



Files used in Ava's Quiz Show: [quiz_game.c], [questions.txt], and [answers.txt]. All other files in Final Code folder were used to test the code in the main file. 


I hope you enjoy Ava's Quiz Show!



compile statement:
	gcc quiz_game.c -o quiz_game
	./quiz_game
