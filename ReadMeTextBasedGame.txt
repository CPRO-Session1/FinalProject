My final project is a text-based adventure game. It consists of a user being stranded on an island, and he has to go through the various steps
to get the equipment to build a boat and get back home.
To finish the game, the answers are in this order:
1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 3, 1. 
I wanted to incorporate enum's and structures in my project, but I just couldn't find a way to do so. Also, I was trying to create a restart button
using a while loop, but every time I tried to make it, it just ended up not compiling/giving me logic errors.
