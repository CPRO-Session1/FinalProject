You, a Bucklandish Hobbit, speak Stoorish, a sub-dialect of Westron(The common tongue). Because of the Wandering Days,
the Stoors borrowed peculiar linguistic manners from the Vales of Anduin or the Angle of Eriador. This will most likely
give you an odd accent that Hobbits of other areas may find endearing but slightly irksome at the same time.
