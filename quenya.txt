The dialect of Elvish you speak is Quenya, derived from one of the oldest Elvish languages, Common Eldarin. In fact, 
Quenya itself is one of the oldest Elvish languages. Often known as "Elf-Latin", Quenya is considered a scholarly 
pursuit, being an old, complex and formal language- however, this dialect is mother-tongue to the Elves of Lothlorien.
