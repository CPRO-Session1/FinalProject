Overview
The My Contacts program is designed to be an efficient contacts directory that is simple and user-friendly, yet allows for quick access to contact details. Unlike a regular contact book, this program is able to categorize contacts into groups, and also add ratings, which is especially useful for businesses such as restaurants.

Functions
This contact book is able to:
- Create and save your contacts
- Add and edit details to each contact, which are name, telephone number, ratings and address
- Create categories to store your contacts under
- Display all your contacts under a category
- Display all categories
- Display contact information of a contact

How to Use
To navigate through the application, use the number keys to select what you want to do. Options of what the application can do for you at the current time will be displayed on the screen, with correspoinding number choices.

The program will function until you 'Exit', which is an option that is also displayed on the screen.

Review
The program is able to do all the functions specified on the project proposal. Input/output, conditional statements, loops, functions, arrays/strings and advanced data types were used to create this program.

The way I coded it was quite different from how I imagined the game would be written. I used fout functions: the main function, a function that reads the number inputs the user selects, a function that creates new contacts and a function that does different things with the categories. I used a lot of if statements especially in the function that deals with the categories, to do different functions with the categories.

Reasons for Making this Program
I chose to do this project because I wanted to create a program that someone would be able to benefit from. I also wanted to create a program that would be quite useful, compared to other types of programs such as games. Enjoy!
