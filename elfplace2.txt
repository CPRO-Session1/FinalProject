Rivendell, meaning 'deep-cut valley', is the western most Elven dwelling in Middle Earth. Set in the foothills of the 
Misty Mountains, Rivendell, also know as "The Last Homely Home", is a place where the spirit of the Elves still survives,
the beauty of their way of life flourishing despite the encroachment of evil in other parts of Middle Earth. The house of Elrond provides refuge for the weary and the opressed, and a treasury of good council and wise lore. Here, you meet the
face of Elven magic, and the two domains of beauty and bliss remain undiminished in the silvery light of Rivendell. Thereare many a merry jest, nights of singing and dancing, and one may dwell in undisturbed peace and ponder... "a little 
sleep does a great cure in the House of Elrond."
