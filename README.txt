	Half the code I had  got deleted. It was an online banking simulator. The main purpose of it was that it was using FILE I/O.
I will be uploading two executables. The both will be semi functional. The first one was the one that was almost complete,
there were a coouple of keey things like deposit withdrawal and history that are not functional. Those should be rather easy to implement
as i would just read from the file then update the values then write to the file. The only important thing to know is that some of the commands are useless
and that the program is case sensitive.

The program was just a more complex banking program that we wrote before. It was going to save everything and all that. I didnt finish the commenting as I was  going to go back and do that and i did not finish the tbank2.c as alot of the code was giving me seg faults and i forgot the code and how i fixed it.
