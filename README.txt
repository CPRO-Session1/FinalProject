This is a game about you being trapped in a dungeon and you have to make decisions in order to escape.
You may type in the number that represents your decision.
The game will proceed towards different endings based on your input.
You will be given the choice of either restart the game or terminate the game whenever you reach the end of that round, so you may make a second attempt if you would like to.
If you input a variable other than the options provided, you will be immediately notified that it was not a valid move.
Simply reenter ./a.out to manually restart the game.
Instruction is also stated at the beginning of the game in case if you forget.

I did make a change that do not follow my original proposal, which is how structures are used in my code. 
I think the reason behind that is: I feel that I was rushing through the project because I was running out of time.

This is what I have accomplished:
Instructions will be given out through printf and player's input can be recognized by scanf.
Player has the ability to decide when to end the game due to a do-while loop I Implemented.

Structures will not be used to store data and progress, but instead give out an evaluation I wrote based on player's performance.

Strings will be printed whenever they are set to.

Only one function is necessary throughout my code and it is void main().
Variables are used everywhere across the code.

Here is what you have to actually input in order to beat the game:
1
2
1
3
either 1 or 2 or 3 (1 and 3 leads to bad end while 2 leads to good end)
