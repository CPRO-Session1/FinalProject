	In this project, I pretty much covered everything I wanted/needed to. I left a good amount of comments throughout the code to explain what each function was doing. In terms of the overarching plan, I created functions that moved the tiles to the right/left/up/down and then created functions that combined simialr blocks. When I finished the basic program, I still wanted to keep going. So, online, I found other functions that improved the quality of the game. For example, I added color to the different size tiles, changed the board itself from simple brackets to clean tiles, and even figured out how to keep the game on a single board as opposed to creating a new board after every move. These additions were not originally in my plan and were simply added due to excess time and boredom.
