My program is a reminders program that lets the user add a reminder. The reminder asks for title, day, time, priority. To use the program, you just have to follow the instructions using abc or 123. 

It can add more reminders or retrieve reminders. If you want to end the program, you can press 'c' as it says on the instructions.

I used a lot of what I have learnt from this class. Such as if statments, pointers, arrays, strings etc. 

However, I did encounter a few bugs. When comparing the string, it did not let me compare the two  strings. I actually had problems with comparing strings before but there was something with my code that made it prblematic again. Nevertheless, the code (which returns invalid) should return the reminders and the list of it.
