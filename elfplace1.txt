Golden, like Autumn Sun, in Lothlorien are ancient things that still walk the waking world. "Here is the heart of 
Elvendom on earth, and here my heart dwells ever". One may think that elves are all Moon and Stars, but Lorien is 
nothing but sunlight and bright day, and yet, more Elvish than anything heard tell of. Here glide the oldest of Elves, 
sits the deepest of wisdom, and lives the most kindly of hearts. Hidden away, you tread a forest, and find yourself in 
a new world, with sights of magnificent marble and beautiful creatures.
