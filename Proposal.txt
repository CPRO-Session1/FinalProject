Proposal:
I'm going to create a text adventure game. The player is
stranded on an island alone. The objective is to create a
boat to get back home. This game is going to
consist of six different locations. On each location will
be a different set of items that will help the player build the boat.
After the player visits each location and chooses the items he/she
believes will help him/her, the item goes back to the beach. Once you get
the necessary items that will allow you to create the boat, the game ends.
Conceptually, I will be using different functions to create this program.
I'll also need a lot of If statements so that if the person chooses an object
from one of the locations, it goes to the beach where it is stored and printed.
Although I don't think loops will be necessary, they might find their way in my project
if deemed necessary.
Thanks
