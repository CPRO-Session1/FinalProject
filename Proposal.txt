Final Project Proposal

For my final project, I want to try and make an old school type game. As a stretch goal, I would like to try and implement a GUI. If all else fails, I will attempt to make it with ascii text. The game will be sort of like a recreation of asteroids, where the goal is to destroy the asteroids in a little space ship. Would also like to try to have enemy AI instead of just asteroids.

Variables/data types, obviously to store different game information and data. Will probably need to use structs to code say the asteroids.

Input/Output, one way or another, I am going to have to try and use unbuffered input. Whether it be GUI or ASCII,  I need a way for the program to detect arrow key movements and whatnot.

Conditional statements, will use these to test if the asteroid hit the ship, etc.

Arrays/Strings, Will need to use strings to display various texts, using pointers to send variables over by reference.

Advanced Data Types, as stated before, will probably need to use structs to code certain pieces of the game that would require a "form." I do not believe I will have a use fo enums.


I have multiple reasons for picking this project.
a) I have always been interested in game design.
b) I really want to test and see how far I can go with pretty much only 2 weeks of actual coding classes, not scratch and dingy "self taught" python.
c) As for the AI, I've been interested in AI for things such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicals. This also includes things such as machine learning.
