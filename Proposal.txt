A simple text adventure game that allows you to pick up items, look around, and go to different rooms. The story I haven’t figured out yet.

Todo:
1.	Player
	a.	structure with
		i.	location (takes room)
		ii.	inventory – array
2.	Inventory
	a.	array of player structure probably
	b.	available items could be an enumerator
3.	Room structure
	a.	each room has a summary when you walk into it
	b.	each room has a different summary for when you look
	c.	Room summaries can change
	d.	rooms have items in them that you can take
4.	Commands
	a.	housed in a player command function
	b.	Look – gives a room’s summary
		i.	in bag = see inventory
	c.	Open – goes to a smaller “room” like a cabinet, closet, etc.
	d.	Go
		i.	Go back, to previous room.
	e.	Take – take an item in environment from inventory
	f.	Help – gives all available commands
	g.	yell – call something, doesn’t do anything most of the time
	h.	Hint – Maybe implement suggested commands
	i.	put – try to put an item in something else
