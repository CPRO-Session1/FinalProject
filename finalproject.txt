Project: Video Shop Database - Olivier Gabison

I'm going to create a system where video store managers can use to log entries of checked out videos.
This includes the video's ID, Name, date of check out, and date of return.

There will be multiple functions of checking if a video is overdue, checking out a video, returning a video,
seeing lists of all the videos you inputted (which I will be using files to save so that even when they close the program, the video
inputs will still remain), editing video details, and viewing video information.

If possible, I may even include a shop where customers can buy movies online with their money (which will be automatically stored
in the video array).

I will be storing each video in a pointer array where the video's ID corresponds to the place in the array. By doing this, it will be
easy to access the video the user is looking for by just inputting the ID.

I want to create this because I really want to use files in my project and using pointer arrays. I'm really interested in the files
aspect of C.

No external libraries will be used.
