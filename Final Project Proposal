Proposal of Final Project  Sheqi

My plan is to write a program that can calculate the frequency of the words appearing in a document.

I want to do this because I think it's useful, and I believe the most important characteristic of computer programming is useful. In addition, I can almost handle it with the things I have learend in the summer program.

Steps:
1. Open document 1 and read it, and judge if it opens successfully at the same time.
2. If open successfully, as well as not reaching the end of the document, then calculate the frequency of a word.
3. Repeat step 2 till the end of the document.
4. Close document 1.
5. Open document 2 and try to record data on it, and judge if it opens successfully at the same time.
6. If open successfully, then record all the words and their frequencies in this document.
7. Close document 2.
8. Make all words fit in a static order (maybe from "a" to "z").
9. Open document 3 and try to record data in it, and judge if it opens successfully at the same time.
10. If open successfully, then record all the words and frequencies in the order in document 3.
11. Close document 3.

How to use loops:
During the process calculating the frequency of one word.
How to use advanced datatypes:
Use structures to combine the words and their frequencies together.
How to use functions:
....
How to use arrays:
In the process of calculating the frequency of one word.
Arrays:
In the structure.

External Library:
I don't understand what is an external library, but I can find external help from my mom. She is a professor in Tsinghua University teaching computer linguistics.
