Online Bank Simulator

The Program would be similiar to the bank project done before but with more features. It would have the user to enter the username
Then it would search for that persons file after that they would have to enter the password. It would have a record
of when things were purchased. I would use structs as the basic why to setup an account. File I/O would be the main part of this as all of this 
would be saved. Most of the thing would be using functions and FileI/O. i dont really see how loops would be that useful.

I am doing this because i have no other ideas also this is the best this i could think of that would help me get use to using FileI/O
which i see as one of the more important thinds.
